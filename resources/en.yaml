title: "RISCOVID: COVID-19 Risk Self-Assessment and Disclosure"
main:
  - Do you want to socialize during the ongoing pandemic? Are you unsure whether your friends and extended family have compatible risk levels? Risk levels are very personal and difficult to assess and disclose. We have prepared a very short and private self-disclosure form that work without recording any information in our servers.
  - Once the form is is completed, its results are summarized into a paragraph of text that can be shared back through email, messaging or social media.
  - Informed decisions can help keep us all safe!
